# SGD-Regressor-for-Multivariate-Linear-Regression

## AIM:
To write a program to predict the price of the house and number of occupants in the house with SGD regressor.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1. Import necessary libraries.
2. Load Data-Read the dataset containing house details.
3. Preprocess Data-Clean and solit the data into training and testing sets.
4. Select features & target-choose input variables(features) and output variables(housenprice,occupants).
5. Train mode-use SGDRegressor() to train the model
6. Make predictions-use the model to predict house price and occupants.
7. Evaluate performance-check accuracy using error metrics.
8. Improve model-tune settings for better accuracy
